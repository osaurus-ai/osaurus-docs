# Tool Contract

Every Osaurus tool — global built-in, folder tool, sandbox tool, plugin tool, MCP-aggregated tool — returns a JSON string in exactly one of two shapes. This page is the one-stop reference for tool authors.

The type lives at `Tools/ToolEnvelope.swift` in the osaurus repo.

## Success envelope

```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "tool": "sandbox_write_file",
  "result": { "path": "/home/agent/foo.txt", "size": 123 },
  "warnings": ["slow disk"]
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `ok` | Always `true` |
| `tool` | Optional — the tool name. Populated automatically by the helpers. |
| `result` | The tool's payload. Object, array, string, number, bool, or null. |
| `warnings` | Optional list of non-fatal notes the model should read |

### `text` convenience

Tools whose primary output is a single human-readable string (folder tools, capability listings, search-memory hits, `todo`/`complete`/`clarify`) use:

```swift
return ToolEnvelope.success(tool: name, text: "Found 3 matches\n...")
```

which is sugar for `result: { "text": "..." }`. The chat UI's tool-call card detects this pattern and renders the text verbatim as Markdown instead of a JSON code block.

## Failure envelope

```json
{
  "ok": false,
  "kind": "invalid_args",
  "message": "Missing required argument `content` (string).",
  "field": "content",
  "expected": "non-empty string of file contents",
  "tool": "sandbox_write_file",
  "retryable": true
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `ok` | Always `false` |
| `kind` | Classification — see the table below |
| `message` | Human- and model-readable explanation |
| `field` | Optional — offending argument name when `kind` is `invalid_args` |
| `expected` | Optional — what the argument should look like (example form) |
| `tool` | Optional — populated automatically |
| `retryable` | Whether a retry might succeed. Defaulted by `kind`. |

### Kinds

| `kind` | meaning | default `retryable` |
|---|---|---|
| `invalid_args` | argument missing, malformed, or scope-incompatible | `true` |
| `rejected` | blocked by configured policy | `false` |
| `user_denied` | user clicked Deny on an interactive approval | `false` |
| `timeout` | tool ran past its time budget | `true` |
| `execution_error` | tool ran but failed (process exited non-zero, file missing…) | `true` |
| `unavailable` | tool exists but can't run right now (sandbox booting, etc.) | `true` |
| `tool_not_found` | model called a tool the registry doesn't have | `false` |

## Detection

Code paths that need to distinguish success from failure without parsing the whole envelope use:

```swift
ToolEnvelope.isError(resultString)     // true for failure envelopes + legacy prefixes
ToolEnvelope.isSuccess(resultString)   // symmetric
ToolEnvelope.successPayload(result)    // returns the `result` dict for a success
ToolEnvelope.failureMessage(result)    // returns `message` (falls back to the input)
```

These also recognise the legacy `[REJECTED]` / `[TIMEOUT]` prefixes and the legacy `ToolErrorEnvelope` JSON shape so partial migrations don't mis-classify.

## Writing a tool

Use the `require…` helpers on `OsaurusTool` to build failure envelopes with the right `field` / `expected` automatically:

```swift
func execute(argumentsJSON: String) async throws -> String {
    let argsReq = requireArgumentsDictionary(argumentsJSON, tool: name)
    guard case .value(let args) = argsReq else { return argsReq.failureEnvelope ?? "" }

    let pathReq = requireString(
        args, "path",
        expected: "relative path under the agent home",
        tool: name
    )
    guard case .value(let path) = pathReq else { return pathReq.failureEnvelope ?? "" }

    // ... do work ...
    return ToolEnvelope.success(tool: name, result: ["path": path, "size": 123])
}
```

Sandbox tools have `requirePath(_:home:tool:)` on top that routes through `SandboxPathSanitizer` and turns a rejection into an `invalid_args` envelope with the specific reason (path traversal, dangerous character, outside allowed roots, etc.).

### Thrown errors

Tool bodies that throw (folder tools, for historical reasons) have the exception mapped to the envelope at the catch site via `ToolEnvelope.fromError(_:tool:)`. That helper understands `FolderToolError`, `ToolRegistry` permission `NSError` codes, and any other `Error` (falls through to `execution_error`).

### Schema

Add `"additionalProperties": false` to every new tool's top-level schema. `SchemaValidator` enforces it at `ToolRegistry.execute` time and emits `invalid_args` with `field: <unknown>` for the model.

Scalar types are intentionally lenient: `integer`, `number`, and `boolean` properties accept native JSON values *and* string-encoded equivalents (`"15"`, `"3.14"`, `"true"`/`"yes"`/`"1"`). `array` properties additionally accept a string that JSON-decodes to an array (`"[\"a\",\"b\"]"`). This matches the tool-side `ArgumentCoercion` helpers so local models that emit slightly off types don't bounce on the preflight when the body would coerce anyway. `string`, `object`, and `enum` checks remain strict, and `array` still rejects bare non-array strings so the model gets a clear signal.

Prefer:

- `enum` for closed-set values (`chartType`, `scope`, `language`, …)
- `default` declared in the schema for any default the implementation uses
- Concrete examples in `description` strings

### Special-case markers (artifact, chart)

`share_artifact` and `render_chart` carry marker-delimited blobs (`---SHARED_ARTIFACT_START---` / `---CHART_START---`) because the chat UI is tightly coupled to those parsers. The markers ride inside the envelope's `result.text` string — downstream parsers extract `text` from the envelope first, then scan for markers. Prefer not to add new marker-based flows; treat them as legacy.

### `share_artifact` failure envelopes

The chat-layer wrapper differentiates four failure modes for `share_artifact` so the model can self-correct on the next turn instead of retrying the same path. Each maps to a specific `ToolEnvelope.failure` shape:

- **Path rejected** (`pathRejected`) → `kind: invalid_args`, `field: "path"`, message names the trusted root and suggests `sandbox_search_files`.
- **File not found** (`fileNotFound`) → `kind: execution_error`, message enumerates every candidate path the resolver tried (e.g. `<home>/foo.png`, `<home>/output/foo.png`, `<home>/dist/foo.png`, …) so the model knows exactly where to look next.
- **Copy failed** (`copyFailed`) → `kind: execution_error`, message carries the FS error string (disk full, perms) plus the source path.
- **Filename rejected** (`destinationRejected`) → `kind: invalid_args`, `field: "filename"`, asks for a plain basename.

Empty-string filler in optional fields (`content: ""`, `filename: ""`) is treated as absent on entry — many models pass empty placeholders for unused fields, and rejecting that as `invalid_args` was a footgun.

### `sandbox_exec` background flag

Foreground (default): returns `{stdout, stderr, exit_code, cwd}` when the command finishes (capped by `timeout`, max 300s). Pass `background:true` to spawn a detached process — the tool returns `{pid, log_file, cwd, background:true}` as soon as the spawn shim returns. Manage the resulting job through `sandbox_process` (poll/wait/kill).
